# LTE (Lower The Entropy)

This project was developed during the <b>SpaceApps Challenge 2018 (Rome)</b>, from an idea of Filippo Curti.

The aim is to generate, given an input image, a puzzle to be recostructed. The main target of this project are (mainly) kids,
that will discover the beauties of the universe (in this example the <i>Pillars of creation</i>, from the <b>Hubble Space Telescope</b>, is used as test image) while also having fun and developing their motor/logical skills.
